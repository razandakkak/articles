## Executive Summary

### Executive Summary

Key global themes highlight escalating geopolitical tensions, climate-related disasters, and emerging health crises, while advancements in technology and corporate developments continue to shape markets. On the geopolitical front, the Israel-Gaza conflict draws significant attention, with humanitarian crises worsening in Gaza and broader instability impacting global sentiment. US tariffs and protectionist policies under the Trump administration are straining international trade dynamics, particularly with India, China, and Brazil. Climate catastrophes, including Himalayan flash floods and Canada’s record wildfires, underscore the urgency of environmental challenges, while China's mosquito-borne virus campaign shows innovative public health measures amid growing outbreaks. 

Technology remains a bright spot, with advances in AI by industry leaders like OpenAI and Google driving optimism, despite concerns over data privacy and mounting emissions linked to AI infrastructure. Corporations across major sectors reveal mixed outcomes—positive news for AI adoption, sustainability measures, and mergers (e.g., ESPN acquiring NFL media) contrasts with economic pressures, such as falling oil revenues in Russia and underwhelming earnings in Europe. For investors, the increasing emphasis on renewable energy investment, AI-driven enterprise solutions, and inflation data driving market rallies provide actionable insights in a volatile environment.

  - Poor safety practices, lack of oversight and toxic workplace blamed for implosion in which five people died
Inadequate safety practices, deliberate efforts to avoid oversight and a “toxic workplace culture” were among the factors that led to the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible, the US Coast Guard has said in a damning report that described the disaster as a “preventable tragedy”.
The submersible was on a commercial voyage to explore the wreck of the Titanic when it disappeared in the Atlantic, leading to the deaths of all five people on board. The ensuing search captured headlines around the world for days as it evolved from a potential rescue mission to a recovery operation.

Hundreds of wildfires continued to burn across Canada and parts of the US on Tuesday sending smoke from the blazes across the region and reducing air quality in both countries.
US air quality tanked from the Great Lakes region to the north-east, making skies hazy from Minneapolis to New York City and even prompting a ground stop at Boston’s Logan international airport due to “low visibility” on Monday. Detroit, New York City and Chicago continued to record some of the worst air quality in the world on Tuesday, according to IQAir, ranking fourth, 10th and 11th respectively.

A decade after the onset of a sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic considered the largest ever documented in the wild, researchers have identified the microbial culprit responsible: a strain of the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida.
In 10 years, the bacterium has ravaged sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a large sea star or starfish, along the western coast of North America, with a loss of 5.8 billion since 2013 – or 90% of the total global population. The sunflower sea star is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of critically endangered species.

An engineer who helped build Melbourne’s public housing towers in the 1960s has condemned the Victorian government’s plan to demolish them, saying it is expensive, unnecessary and environmentally irresponsible.
Gerry Noonan, who worked on most of the city’s 44 towers, told a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into their redevelopment they should be refurbished and upgraded instead – citing the financial cost and carbon impact of demolition and rebuilding.

- **Middle East crisis live: 20 killed as aid truck overturns in Gaza, civil defence agency says** (negative)
  - Truck drivers have said delivering aid has become increasingly dangerous, while Hamas has accused Israel of forcing drivers to take unsafe routes
Iran executed two men in separate cases on Wednesday, accusing one of spying for Israel and another of being a member of the Islamic State (IS) group, state media reported, according to the Associated Press (AP).

 A report by the judiciary news website Mizanonline identified the alleged spy as Rouzbeh Vadi, who was accused of relaying classified information to Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad. 

 Authorities said Vadi provided information about an Iranian nuclear scientist who was killed during Israel’s June airstrikes on Iran, according to the report, which did not identify the scientist or the time and place of Vadi’s arrest.

 Vadi met the Mossad officers five times in Vienna, Austria, the report said.

 Israel’s ambassador to France, Joshua Zarka, said in June that Israel’s 12-day war on Iran included targeted strikes that killed at least 14 physicists and engineers involved with Iran’s nuclear programme.

 Iran has hanged seven people for espionage during the conflict with Israel, sparking fears from activists that the government could conduct a wave of executions.

 Iran separately hanged a man they said was a member of IS on Wednesday after he was convicted of plotting sabotage, Mizanonline reported. Officials accused Mehdi Asgharzadeh of participating in military training in Syria and Iraq before illegally entering Iran with a four-member team who were killed in a fight with Iranian security, the news site reported.

 Authorities said Iran’s supreme court upheld the sentences of lower courts and followed full legal procedures before executing both men, Mizanonline reported.
The Guardian was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a Jordanian military aircraft providing aid. Israel announced last week that it had resumed coordinated humanitarian airdrops over Gaza, following mounting international pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies, which has reached such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there.

- **How gerrymandering became a blood sport** (negative)
  - Fights over Congressional maps never used to be this intense. On Tuesday, Texas Republicans voted to issue civil arrest warrants for Democrats who fled the state.
The GOP is trying to redraw house districts, and the proposed new map could give Republicans as many as five more House seats. That change could easily decide control of Congress. 
This fight is rippling out to other states too with President Trump urging Republicans to follow the lead of Texas. And Democratic governors saying they might follow the same path. 
Trump can be this transparent because there are no federal restrictions on redrawing districts for purely partisan gain. The Supreme Court said so in 2019.
Gerrymandering has been part of U.S. politics for hundreds of years. How did it become a bloodsport?

In his farewell TV address last night, outgoing president Duda trumpeted his successes as the country’s president, saying he fought against the impossibilism of political rivals and at the end of his 10 years in office leaves Poland as “a completely different country: stronger, safer, taken more seriously abroad, and serving its citizens better.”
But he also leaves behind a deeply divisive legacy.

- **UK to bear transport costs of ‘one in, one out’ asylum seeker deal with France** (neutral)
  - Treaty can be ended by either side at a month’s notice and France can refuse returns on certain grounds
The UK will pay the costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France under Keir Starmer’s “one in, one out” deal with Emmanuel Macron, it has emerged.
The deal will have to be renewed by 11 June next year, and can be ended at a month’s notice by either side, documents made public by the government indicate.

On Ukraine, the EU spokespeople were asked about the bloc’s expectations as to Donald Trump’s deadline for Russia to end its invasion on Ukraine by Friday.
The commission’s foreign policy spokesperson, Anitta Hipper, said:
“Russia is not interested in peace. Ukraine is, the EU is. Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine and the EU. …
We welcome any pressure, and in particular US pressure on Russia to accept a ceasefire through any means necessary.”
“I believe that for what we have been able to verify … there has been some improvement compared to the situation before this agreement was reached. 
Is this sufficient? Absolutely not.

- **Trump’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil puts Modi in tight spot** (negative)
  - Prime minister faces a choice between high tariffs or giving up cheap oil, putting New Delhi’s non-alignment policy under severe strain
The relationship between India and the US is facing one of its most significant challenges in decades, as the Trump administration doubles down on its demands that India stop buying Russian oil or face punitive tariffs.
The US president, Donald Trump, has refused to cut tariffs on Indian exports to the US, as he has for other countries, and on Monday said he would significantly raise them over its purchases of cheap Russian oil, which now account for one-third of its imported oil.

  - No pause on Russian imports by Indian oil firms who base decisions on ‘price, grade of crude, logistics and economic factors’
Indian oil refineries will continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have said, before threatened US sanctions next week against Moscow’s trading partners over the war in Ukraine.
Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true.

- **‘Worrying’ levels of screen time means young people losing confidence to socialise in person, minister warns – UK politics live** (positive)
  - Culture secretary Lisa Nandy says ‘majority of young people spend all, or almost all, of their free time alone in their bedrooms, online’
Good morning. Keir Starmer is out on a visit today and he will be doing broadcast interviews. It may be the only time we hear from him this week, and there is no shortage of topics that journalists will want to ask him about. By the end of the day we may get new, or newish, lines on Gaza, the “one in, one out” returns deal with France, tax rises and the black hole in the government’s finances (priced at more than £40bn, according to a report from a well-respected thinktank today), Ukraine, the case for and against disclosing suspects’ immigration status and the demonstration planned for this weekend against the decision to proscribe Palestinian Action.
But Starmer wants to talk about something else – less party political, less ‘Westminster agenda’, but arguably as or even more important than these other topics: what the internet is doing to our children.
Growing up today is hard for young people. As they navigate their way through the online world, too often they find themselves isolated at home and disconnected from their communities.
As a government, we have a duty to act on this worrying trend. Today’s investment is about offering a better alternative: transformative, real-world opportunities that will have an impact in communities across the country, so young people can discover something new, find their spark and develop the confidence and life skills that no algorithm can teach.
It keeps me awake at night. We when we were first elected into government last year, one of the first things that I did was to appoint a group of young people to oversee the first national youth strategy in several decades. I was astonished to find that we didn’t have one.
What we found through that process is that the majority of young people – and it does appear to be a majority – spend all, or almost all, of their free time alone in their bedrooms, online, and are losing their confidence to connect to people in the real world.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) is expanding its detention capacity by 1,000 beds in Indiana through a partnership with the midwest state’s prison system, federal officials announced on Tuesday.
Ice will be housing detainees at the Miami correctional center, a prison run by the Indiana department of corrections. The move is part of the US government’s rapid expansion of immigration jails after Donald Trump’s sweeping spending bill allotted roughly $170bn to Ice, an extraordinary sum making the agency the most heavily funded law enforcement department within the federal government.

- **Texas senator asks FBI to help locate and arrest Democrats for leaving state** (negative)

The US senator John Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid Texas law enforcement in locating and arresting Democrats who left the state to forestall a plan sought by Donald Trump to aggressively redraw the state’s congressional map in a way that could help Republicans keep their House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.
The senator’s request is a significant escalation in the fast-moving showdown that could set up a confrontation between the blue state leaders shielding the Democratic state lawmakers and the Trump administration. Earlier on Tuesday, Texas Democrats denied a legislative quorum for the second day in a row by scattering across the country, with many decamping to Chicago, Illinois, where the Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, has vowed to protect them.
