## Executive Summary

### **Executive Summary**
Recent global news highlights several key themes of interest to business leaders and investors. Foremost, geopolitical volatility continues to dominate headlines, with intensified conflicts in the Middle East, particularly Israeli strikes in Gaza, and U.S.-China tensions over semiconductors, trade, and tariffs. Escalating U.S. tariffs, including a significant 50% hike on Indian goods, have rattled exporters and markets, creating ripple effects in global supply chains. Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine war remains a significant concern as energy and security dynamics intensify, impacting European political alliances and energy strategies.

Amid these challenges, some sectors show promise. The technology space continues to deliver strong performance, with Nvidia's anticipated earnings pointing to ongoing leadership in the AI revolution. Clean energy investment also gains momentum as Africa capitalizes on China's surplus solar production, while companies like Meta and Google forge ahead in advanced AI and infrastructure. Despite global economic headwinds, opportunities abound through innovative technologies and sustainability-focused ventures. However, risks related to inflation, volatile market conditions, and regulatory uncertainties remain significant focal points for decision-makers.

  - Netanyahu continues to prepare Gaza City offensive as mediators await response to ceasefire proposal
Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations across Israel on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and calling off plans to attack Gaza City.
Relatives of hostages led the biggest march and rally in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered outside the prime minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the war. There were dozens of other protests around the country, including on the main highway to the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport.

- **Hundreds of senior diplomats call for EU to take urgent action over Gaza crisis – as it happened** (negative)
  - Open letter has been signed by 209 former EU ambassadors, senior diplomatic staff and ambassadors from EU nation states
The UN says that Israel must not only investigate alleged unlawful killings in Gaza like the hospital strike that killed 20 people, including journalists, the previous day, but also ensure those probes yield results.
“There needs to be justice,” United Nations rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told AFP in Geneva, adding that the large number of media workers killed in the Gaza war “raises many, many questions about the targeting of journalists”.
The Israeli authorities have, in the past, announced investigations in such killings.
It’s of course the responsibility of Israel, as the occupying power, to investigate - but these investigations need to yield results.

  - If Tehran was behind antisemitic attacks in Australia, experts say it is a sign of weakness rather than strength
Iran’s involvement in clandestine violence and espionage overseas takes many forms, but all have a single aim – to win advantage for Tehran by striking unexpectedly at the “soft underbelly” of enemies.
It’s a strategy that dates back to the 1979 revolution, and is rooted in a pragmatic if regretful assessment of Iran’s continuing weakness on the conventional battlefield.

Heavy monsoon rains have continued to pummel the Indian subcontinent over the past week, bringing devastating flooding and landslides and leaving hundreds of people dead in what has already been one of the deadliest monsoon seasons in recent years.
Moist air surging inland from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea was driven into Pakistan and north-west India late last week by strong southwesterly monsoon winds. Combined with developing areas of low pressure, this triggered a succession of torrential downpours.

- **Domestic violence is leading cause of homicide in Utah amid Trump cuts** (negative)
  - US president cuts funding for victims as state faces more than a third of killings from partner or familial violence
Domestic violence is the leading cause of homicide in Utah, according to an analysis of FBI and state data by a local news station in Salt Lake City. The investigation is based on intimate partner homicide data recently released by the state.
The station, Fox 13, found that 51 – more than a third – of the 137 homicides between July 2023 and January 2025 were the result of intimate partner or familial violence. The majority of the perpetrators were men, while the sexes of the victim were nearly evenly split, with 26 male and 25 female victims. This could be because in many cases, there were multiple victims, including a victim’s children, parents or siblings.

- **First Thing: UN demands justice over Israel’s double bombing of Gaza hospital** (negative)
  - Human rights office says attack, which killed 20 people, raises questions about the targeting of journalists. Plus, painting looted by Nazis spotted in Argentina 
Good morning.
The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double-tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, which killed 20 people including five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability.
What does international law say about the attack? It may constitute a war crime on many fronts, writes the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont. “What is striking about this incident is that each individual element – the targeting of a working hospital, of journalists and rescue workers, of injured civilians already under treatment – would be expected to draw accusations of a war crime in its own right,” he writes.
Who were the five Palestinian journalists killed? Their names were Moaz Abu Taha, Mariam Abu Dagga, Mohammad Salama, Ahmed Abu Aziz and Hussam al-Masri, and you can read their stories here. “He loved his work deeply,” said Abu Taha’s brother Adly.
Meanwhile, what is happening in Israel? Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and call off plans to attack Gaza City.

It follows Trump’s move to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook.
