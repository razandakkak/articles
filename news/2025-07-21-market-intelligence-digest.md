It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.

Hutton issued his own statement declaring that the “Greens have been taken over by a cult”:
They have abandoned the historic mission I believed they had when I founded the party, a mission to help bring about an ecologically sustainable world. Like all cults they are deeply authoritarian and don’t believe in freedom of speech.
They should change the name of the party from the Greens to the Extreme Transgender Party.
This decision reflects the Greens’ position as endorsed by its membership – that trans rights are non-negotiable human rights, a position publicly reaffirmed in 2022. No one should be subjected to violence or hate speech on the basis of their gender, nor their race, sexual identity, ethnicity, or religion.
It is disheartening to see that Mr Hutton has prioritised his perceived right to free speech over the safety of others.

The children of an elderly couple imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan have urged the group to release the pair before they “die in custody”.
They said the UN would be making a statement on Monday calling for the immediate release of Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, who were arrested as they travelled to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan, in February.

By the time Bangladesh’s student-led revolution finally toppled Sheikh Hasina, her security forces had already spilled the blood of hundreds of protesters.
Now, almost a year after the country’s autocratic leader fled the former British colony into exile, an interim government is struggling to navigate bitter factional politics and economic turmoil.

This week an email was sent to people in Afghanistan. It told the recipients, who had all worked for British forces in Afghanistan, that some of their personal data “may have been compromised”. All had applied for asylum in the UK, fearful because their work for Britain made them a target for the Taliban. Now they were told their asylum applications had been leaked into the public domain.
They were advised not to take phone calls or respond to messages or emails from unknown contacts, to limit access to their social media, to consider closing their accounts, and to only go online via a private connection. Understandably, they were terrified.

Air India has said it found “no issues” with the fuel switches on its other Boeing planes after the fatal crash that killed 260 people last month, as a US report suggested investigators have turned their attention to the actions of the plane’s captain.
A preliminary report into the incident, released last week, found that the switches that controlled fuel going into the engines had been turned off “one after another” just after the plane took off from Ahmedabad airport.

Tony Diver, the Telegraph’s associate political editor, is among the journalists at Nigel Farage’s conference. He has shared Reform’s policy document supposedly showing how the party would pay for their policies:
Nigel Farage has been speaking at a press conference in London about what he has framed as “lawless Britain”. Here are some of the highlights of the conference, which you can watch at the top of the blog. The Reform leader did not cite specific evidence or data to back up many of his claims:
He claims successive home secretaries have based claims that crimes in England and Wales are falling on “completely false data”. He says if you look at police recorded crimes there are “significant” rises in crime, particularly those against the person.
Farage says we are facing “nothing short of societal collapse” in many parts of the country, with “people scared to go out to the shops” and to “let their kids out”.
He says criminals and law-abiding citizens respect police less than they used to.
He says low level offences – like phone snatching and shop lifting – are rife in London and not being prosecuted.
Most people don’t even bother calling the police to report a crime because they know officers are unlikely to take any action, Farage said.
Farage said that “nobody in London understands how close we are to civil disobedience” in Britain.
He said that offenders convicted of more than three serious crimes should be “on a course towards life imprisonment”.
Reform would put more knife arches in train stations and other transport hubs to clamp down on crime, Farage suggested.
He said that every shoplifting offence would be prosecuted and every mobile phone theft investigated if Reform got into government at the next election.

On a clear February evening in 2020, a smell of rotten eggs started to waft over the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, followed by a green-tinged cloud. A load roar could be heard near the highway that passes the town.
Soon, nearby residents started to feel dizzy, some even passed out or lay on the ground shaking, unable to breathe. Cars, inexplicably, cut out, their drivers leaving them abandoned with the doors open on the highway.

In 2022, more than 90% of young children in Sudan received their routine vaccinations. But that figure has nearly halved to 48%, the lowest in the world, according to the World Health Organization.

Gaza’s health ministry said scores were killed by Israeli fire while waiting for UN aid trucks entering through the northern Zikim crossing with Israel. It was one of the highest reported death tolls among repeated recent cases in which aid seekers have been killed by Israeli fire.
