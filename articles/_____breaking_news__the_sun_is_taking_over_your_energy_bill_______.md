🚨 **Breaking News: The Sun is Taking Over Your Energy Bill!** ☀️⚡

Ladies and gentlemen, behold the *pie chart of power struggles* 🍕—where solar energy casually flexes its muscles with a *mic-drop-worthy* 74.83% of total energy production (that's 10,292,307.00 kWh, for the stat nerds). Yep, it seems the sun is on a mission to make ALL other energy sources feel inadequate. 

Meanwhile, G3 and G1 Energy are fighting over second place like siblings (both hovering around a respectable 10%), and G2 Energy is that underdog in the corner contributing a modest 3.08%. And let’s take a moment of silence for "Total Discharge Energy" (1.22%) and "EDL" (0.26%)—because someone has to represent "barely there" energy.  

✨ **Moral of the story?**  
If you're not riding the solar wave yet, what are you waiting for? Your *home* deserves better than the energy equivalent of crumbs 🍞! 🏡💡
